The dataset is known as the KDDÕ99 NIDS dataset. 

The dataset contains network traffic samples (as flows) generated from active network attacks and baseline activity. 

Further details and the original, unprocessed data can be found here:

The KDDÕ99 dataset that you have been given has been preprocessed into normalized features and divided into training and testing splits. 

The training split contains only baseline traffic samples and is provided in the file named training_normal.npy.

The testing data is organized into two files: one for testing on unseen baseline traffic (named testing_normal.npy), and another for testing on anomalous malicious traffic (named testing_attack.npy).

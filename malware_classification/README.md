## Malware Classification
This project provides an easy way to implement and test malware classification using Support Vector Machines and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
Current iteration realizes One-vs-One and One-vs-All to classify malware families.
The [report](malware_classification/docs/report.pdf) shows the full process of creating them, as well as various experimentation stages with classifier parameters.

### Setup
1. Install all the libraries specified in [requirements.txt](malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt)
2. If needed add the _feature\_vectors.zip_ and _sha256\_family.csv_ data files to 'malware_classification/corpus/'
3. The script will test a generic SVM and show accuracy. The script will also perform multi-class classification using One-vs-One and One-vs-All techniques to produce a confusion matrix and accuracy for the classifier.

    b. [One-vs-All confusion matrix](malware_classification/graphs/confusion_matrix_One-vs-All.png)
4. To run the project ensure you are in the root directory _malware\_classification/classifiers/_ and run the following in a command line of your choice: 

```sh
pip install -r malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt
python3 malware_classification/classifier/main.py
```

### Value Search and Graphs
1. If you need to find a parameter value that works best for a classifier, utilize the other methods in main.

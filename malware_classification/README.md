## Malware Classification
This project provides a highly scalable way of implementing and testing malware classification using Support Vector Machines with Stochastic Gradient Descent.
It additionally realizes One-vs-One and One-vs-All multiclass classifiers. 
The [report](malware_classification/docs/report.pdf) shows the full process of creating them, as well as various experimentation stages with classifier parameters.

### Setup
1. Install all the libraries specified in [requirements.txt](malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt)
2. If needed add the _feature\_vectors.zip_ and _sha256\_family.csv_ data files to 'malware_classification/corpus/'
3. The script will test a generic SVM and show accuracy. 
4. To see One-vs-One and One-vs-All model performance and confusion matrices, uncomment the lines accordingly. To find the matrices, navigate to 'malware_classification/graphs'
4. To run the project ensure you are in the root directory (the directory containing the malware_classification folder) and run the following in the terminal:

```sh
pip install -r malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt
python3 malware_classification/classifier/main.py
```

### Hyperparameter Search
1. [main.py](malware_classification/classifiers/main.py) contains the grid search that can be used to find optimal hyperparameters.

# Machine Learning
This repository is a collection of various machine learning projects.

## Malware Classification
This project provides a highly scalable way of implementing and testing malware classification using Support Vector Machines with Stochastic Gradient Descent.
It additionally realizes One-vs-One and One-vs-All multiclass classifiers. 
The [report](malware_classification/docs/report.pdf) shows the full process of creating them, as well as various experimentation stages with classifier parameters.

### Setup
1. Install all the libraries specified in [requirements.txt](malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt)
2. If needed add the _feature\_vectors.zip_ and _sha256\_family.csv_ data files to 'malware_classification/corpus/'
3. The script will test a generic SVM and show accuracy. 
4. To see One-vs-One and One-vs-All model performance and confusion matrices, uncomment the lines accordingly. To find the matrices, navigate to 'malware_classification/graphs'
4. To run the project ensure you are in the root directory (the directory containing the malware_classification folder) and run the following in the terminal:

```sh
pip install -r malware_classification/docs/requirements.txt
python3 malware_classification/classifier/main.py
```

### Hyperparameter Search
1. [main.py](malware_classification/classifiers/main.py) contains the grid search that can be used to find optimal hyperparameters.

## Anomaly Detection using Clustering
This project provides an easy way to implement and test anomaly detection using clustering algorithms.
Current iteration implements DBScan and K-Means algorithms.
The [report](anomaly_detection/docs/report.pdf) shows the full process of creating them, as well as various experimentation stages with hyperparameters.
Final results are shown using somewhat neat graphs.

### Setup
1. Install all the libraries specified in [requirements.txt](anomaly_detection/docs/requirements.txt)
2. If needed, adjust the _data_ list in _main()_ in [main.py](anomaly_detection/clustering/main.py). This is not needed for the assignment - everything is already set up by default.
3. The script will show accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate and F1 scores for the given clusterer. It also draws the graphs in [graphs](anomaly_detection/graphs)

```sh
pip install -r anomaly_detection/docs/requirements.txt
python3 anomaly_detection/clustering/main.py
```

### Value Search and Graphs
1. If you need to find a parameter value that works best for a clustering algorithm, utilize the other methods in main. 

## Spam Detector Classification
This project provides an easy way to implement and test spam detection using classifiers.
Current iteration realizes Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers.
The [report](spam_classification/docs/report.pdf) shows the full process of creating them, as well as various experimentation stages with classifier parameters.
Final results are shown using neat graphs.

### Setup
1. Install all the libraries specified in [requirements.txt](spam_classification/docs/requirements.txt)
2. If needed, adjust the _classifiers_ dictionary or the data path in _main()_ in [main.py](spam_classification/classifier/main.py). This is not needed for the assignment - everything is already set up by default.
3. The script will show accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores for the given classifiers. It also puts the results [results.txt](spam_classification/docs/results.txt)
4. Note that you will need additional libraries not included in _requirements.txt_ if you plan to run value search or plotting methods. These are included in [optional_requirements.txt](classifier/optional_requirements.txt)

```sh
pip install -r spam_classification/docs/requirements.txt
python3 spam_classification/classifier/main.py
```

### Value Search and Graphs
1. If you need to find a parameter value that works best for a classifier, you are out of luck - the code was refactored and value tester no longer works. _make_graph()_ still works for old testing data.
2. Once testing is done, [make_graph.py](spam_classification/classifier/make_graph.py) provides a way to plot line graphs based on test results. Disclaimer: the method currently only looks at the first value that it finds to be changing in a subset of the test results. It first looks at Stop Word â€° Removed. If it changes, it will not look at other parameters! If not, it goes one by one through parameters until it finds the first one that changes.
